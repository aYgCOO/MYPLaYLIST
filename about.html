          👋 Hello! Welcome to my website.My name is Ayanabha Chatterjee. I'm 19
          years old. My main only purpas to create this website👨‍💻 to store my
          previous youtube videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic Frontend Web Developer with a passion
          for creating engaging user experiences. My journey in the world of
          technology has been a dynamic one, shaped by my insatiable curiosity
          and an unwavering commitment to learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          🌐My primary focus is on Frontend Web Development, where I craft
          intuitive and responsive web interfaces that seamlessly merge design
          and functionality. I have a keen eye for user-centred design and an
          appreciation for the finer details that elevate a website from good to
          exceptional.
        </p>
        <p>
          💼 Additionally, I'm on a quest to become a versatile Full Stack Web
          Developer, adept in both MEAN and MEARN stacks. This journey allows me
          to bridge the gap between the frontend and backend, enabling me to
          bring complete web solutions to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          🚀 My technical toolkit includes proficiency with a deep understanding
          of HTML, and CSS and currently I learning JavaScript. I'm well-versed
          in databases (including SQL and NoSQL).
        </p>
        <p>
          💡 Beyond web development, I have a solid foundation in Python, C,
          C++, and Java, thanks to my experience in Data Structures and
          Algorithms. My knowledge extends to fundamental computer concepts such
          as Computer Architecture, Database Management Systems (DBMS), Computer
          Hardware, and Linux-based Operating Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          🎨 On the creative side, I dabble in basic graphic design, enhancing
          my ability to create visually appealing web experiences. I'm also
          proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, which proves handy for
          documentation and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          📚 I firmly believe in the power of continuous learning and
          adaptability. The pursuit of knowledge is not just a hobby; it's my
          driving force. I thrive in dynamic environments and embrace challenges
          as opportunities for growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          🤝 Let's connect and explore possibilities! Whether it's collaborating
          on exciting projects, sharing insights, or discussing the latest
          developments in the tech world, I'm always eager to engage with fellow
